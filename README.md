# Hi 👋🏼 I'm Ella Owens
### I am currently a **cyber security fellow**, in the TKH Innovation Fellowship, learning the principles of cybersecurity networking and preforming security operation & optimization for security functions in AWS cloud.

I am learning and implementing best practices to securely build and scale cloud-native applications and configure network security defenses within the cloud environment. I have also gained extensive knowledge on providing security solutions, architectural design, development, deployment and optimization for security functions in AWS cloud.

Throughout my time in the TKH cybersecurity fellowship, I have participated in a collaborative team to demonstrate an understanding and application of AWS services for building a secure lab in the AWS Cloud environment. The project involved leveraging AWS services to create a secure infrastructure that can protect against various cyber threats and attacks. For the final months of this cybersecurity fellowship, I am joining other students to create a capstone project. GitHub allows us to document our work while demonstrating our understanding of what we have learned and continue to learn.

•	I have taken and passed the ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity certification and am focused on passing the CompTIA Security+ and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications in the near future.📚


• Eu também estou aprendendo português🌴
