I am a graduate of The Knowledge House's Innovation Fellowship in cybersecurity, where I built a strong foundation in network security and AWS cloud security. I gained hands-on experience in developing and scaling cloud-native applications, optimizing security operations, and designing secure AWS infrastructures. A standout project was my team's work on the **"[Cybersecurity Training Range](https://github.com/cybertrainingrange/cybertraininingrange.io/blob/main/README.md),"** demonstrating my ability to design and deploy secure AWS environments.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a strong background in project management. During my internship with the ACLU as a Technical Product Manager, I evaluated legal case management systems (CMS), created a feature's scorecard, and provided insights that directly informed key decision-making processes. I also collaborated with Wikimedia on a project management capstone, further strengthening my ability to lead projects that drive meaningful outcomes.

My diverse skill set in both cybersecurity and project management enables me to approach complex challenges with a holistic perspective. I am currently preparing for the Certified Associate in Project Management (**CAPM**) exam, scheduled for April 2025, to further solidify my project management expertise.
